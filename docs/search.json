If a variable was created by members of the Pelham Lab, you will not be able to find it in the ABCD Data Dictionary.\nVariables can contain information about the type of instrument (e.g. demographics) and a number indicating the order it appears in the instrument.\n\nData pertaining to the same variable can be separated into baseline and longitudinal variables. Longitudinal variables and baseline variables appear the same except for the “_l” suffix at the end of the variable name."
